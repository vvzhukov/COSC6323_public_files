# A statistical method is called non-parametric if it 
# makes no assumption on the population distribution 
# or sample size.

# I. Wilcoxon signed rank test (One-sample nonparametric Test)
# The one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test is a 
# non-parametric alternative to one-sample t-test 
# when the data cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.

# IMPORTANT assumption:
# - the data should be distributed symmetrically (median) 

#if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")

# HOW-TO
# wilcox.test(x, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided")
# x: a numeric vector containing your data values
# mu: the theoretical mean/median value (default - 0). 
# alternative: the alternative hypothesis. 
# Allowed value is one of “two.sided” (default), “greater” or “less”.

# Here, we will use an example data set containing 
# the weight of 10 mice.
set.seed(1234)
my_data <- data.frame(
    name = paste0(rep("M_", 10), 1:10),
    weight = round(rnorm(10, 20, 2), 1)
)

# We want to know, if the average weight of the 
# mice differs from 25g (two-tailed test)?

# One-sample wilcoxon test
res <- wilcox.test(my_data$weight, mu = 25)
# Printing the results
res 

# print only the p-value
res$p.value

# reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the 
# average weight of the mice is significantly 
# different from 25g with a p-value = 0.005793

# test whether the median weight of mice is 
# less than 25g (one-tailed test)
wilcox.test(my_data$weight, mu = 25,

# The unpaired two-samples Wilcoxon test

# We can conclude that men’s median weight is

# Example 1
## Hollander & Wolfe (1973), p. 140ff.
## Comparison of three methods ("round out", "narrow angle", and
##  "wide angle") for rounding first base.  For each of 18 players
##  and the three method, the average time of two runs from a point on
##  the first base line 35ft from home plate to a point 15ft short of
##  second base is recorded.

# VI. Bootstrapping
# bootstrap re sampling method can be used to measure 
# the accuracy of a predictive model. Additionally, 
# it can be used to measure the uncertainty associated 
# with any statistical estimator.

# Following example uses a bootstrap with 100 re samples 
# to test a linear regression model:
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)

# Load the data
?swiss
data("swiss")
# Inspect the data
sample_n(swiss, 3)

# Define training control
?caret::train
train.control <- trainControl(method = "boot", number = 100)
# Train the model
model <- train(Fertility ~., data = swiss, method = "lm",
               trControl = train.control)
# Summarize the results
print(model)

# Creating a function that returns the regression model 
# coefficients:

model_coef <- function(data, index){
    coef(lm(Fertility ~., data = data, subset = index))
}
model_coef(swiss, 1:47)

# Compute the standard errors of 500 bootstrap 
# estimates for the coefficients
library(boot)
?boot
# Generate R bootstrap replicates of a statistic 
# applied to data.
boot(swiss, model_coef, 500)

# Here:
# 'original' column corresponds to the regression coefficients
# 'std.error' associated standard errors

# For example 95% CI (b =- 2*SE(b)):
# SE for Agriculture (t2*) is 0.06
# then the lower limit:
-0.172 - (2*0.06)
# and upper:
-0.172 + (2*0.06)

# So there is 95% chance that interval [-0.292, -0.052] 
# will contain the true value of the coefficient

summary(lm(Fertility ~., data = swiss))$coef
# LM gives you different results as it relies on some 
# assumptions regarding the data

# bootstrap approach does not rely on any of these 
# assumptions made by the linear model, and so it 
# is likely giving a more accurate estimate of the 
# coefficients standard errors than is the summary() function.
