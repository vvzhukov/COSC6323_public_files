# MEDIAN
?median()

# Probability Density - d...()

# Quantile - q...()


## NORMAL
?dnorm()
# This function gives height of the probability distribution at each point 
# for a given mean and standard deviation.

# Create a sequence of numbers between -10 and 10 incrementing by 0.1.
x <- seq(-10, 10, by = .1)
# Choose the mean as 2.5 and standard deviation as 1.5.
y <- dnorm(x, mean = 2.5, sd = 1.5)
# Give the chart file a name.
plot(x,y)

# Another sample
y <- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 3.5)
plot(x,y)

?pnorm()
# Gives the probability of a normally distributed random number to be less that the 
# value of a given number. It is also called "Cumulative Distribution Function"

?qnorm()
# Takes the probability value and gives a number whose cumulative value matches 
# the probability value

?rnorm()
# generate random numbers whose distribution is normal. 
# It takes the sample size as input and generates that many random numbers.

## BINOMIAL
?dbinom()
# This function gives the probability density distribution at each point.

# Create a sample of 50 numbers which are incremented by 1.
x <- seq(0,50,by = 1)
# Create the binomial distribution.
y <- dbinom(x,50,0.5)
# Plot the graph for this sample.
plot(x,y)
