# What is ARMA model?
# Yt follows an ARMA(p,q) if and only if it can be 
# represented as a combination of an Autoregressive 
# model AR(p) and a Moving Average model of order q, MA(q).

# What is ARIMA model?
# Variant of ARMA
# ARIMA(p,r,q), where 
# p is the number of lags for the autoregressive part, 
# q the number of lags of the Moving average part and 
# r is the number of time we should differentiate in 
# order to obtain a stationary ARMA model.

# Autocorrelation
# A time series is a sequence of measurements of the same 
# variable(s) made over time. Usually, the measurements 
# are made at evenly spaced times — for example, 
# monthly or yearly. The coefficient of correlation between 
# two values in a time series is called the autocorrelation 
# function (ACF). In other words, Autocorrelation represents 
# the degree of similarity between a given time series and a 
# lagged version of itself over successive time intervals.

# Autocorrelation measures the relationship between a 
# variable’s current value and its past values.
# An autocorrelation of +1 represents a perfect positive 
# correlation, while an autocorrelation of negative 1 
# represents a perfect negative correlation.


# Why do we need it?
# 1. Help us uncover hidden patterns in our data and help us 
# select the correct forecasting methods.
# 2. Help identify seasonality in our time series data.
# 3. Analyzing the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial 
# autocorrelation function (PACF) in conjunction is necessary 
# for selecting the appropriate ARIMA model for any time series 
# prediction.

# The partial autocorrelations tail off to zero after lag 3

# Since the correlogram is zero after lag 1, and the partial 
# correlogram tails off to zero after lag 3, this means that 
# the following ARMA (autoregressive moving average) models are 
# possible for the time series of first differences:
    
# ARMA(3,0) model, that is, an autoregressive 
#        model of order p=3, since the partial autocorrelogram 
#        is zero after lag 3, and the autocorrelogram tails off 
#        to zero (although perhaps too abruptly for this model 
#        to be appropriate)
# ARMA(0,1) model, that is, a moving average model of order q=1, 
#        since the autocorrelogram is zero after lag 1 and the 
#        partial autocorrelogram tails off to zero
# ARMA(p,q) model, that is, a mixed model with p and q greater 
#        than 0, since the autocorrelogram and partial 
#        correlogram tail off to zero (although the correlogram 
#        probably tails off to zero too abruptly for this model 
#        to be appropriate)

# The ARMA(3,0) model has 3 parameters, the ARMA(0,1) model 
# has 1 parameter, and the ARMA(p,q) model has at least 2 
# parameters. Therefore, the ARMA(0,1) model is taken as 
# the best model.

# Since an ARMA(0,1) model (with p=0, q=1) is taken to be the 
# best candidate model for the time series of first differences 
# of the ages at death of English kings, then the original time 
# series of the ages of death can be modelled using an 
# ARIMA(0,1,1) model (with p=0, d=1, q=1, where d is the 
# order of differencing required).

# Since the correlogram tails off to zero after lag 3,

# ARMA(2,0) pacf is zero after lag 2, and the correlogram tails off to zero after lag 3, and the partial correlogram is zero after lag 2
